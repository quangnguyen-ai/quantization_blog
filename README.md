# Quantization for Real-Time AI Inference

A technical exploration of neural network quantization techniques, from mathematical foundations to production deployment challenges on edge devices.

## 📚 Content

**[Part 1: Quantization - A Solution for Real-Time Inference](part1/quantization.MD)**

An in-depth article covering quantization fundamentals, mathematical formulation, quantization strategies (weight-only vs. full INT8), and real-world deployment considerations. Includes concrete examples from deploying models on Qualcomm (SNPE/QNN), NVIDIA Jetson (TensorRT), and Renesas platforms, with benchmarks showing 40-70% latency reduction and 4× memory optimization.
